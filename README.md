# Biologically-Inspired-Algorithms

Code for optimising two Biologically Inspired Algorithms. 

1) Genetic Algorithm: a population of solutions to the Algorithm are compared with themselves and components of the best solutions are passed onto the subsequent generations.
2) Particle Swarm Algorithm: a collection of particles search the solution space sharing infomation (location, velocity, fitness) amongst themselves to encourage other particles to move towards an optimal solution.
